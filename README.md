# Data Science Portfolio – Randal Burks

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository highlights selected projects that demonstrate my skills in machine learning, data visualization, and statistical modeling.  

## Projects

### [Skin Tone Detection Using Image Segmentation and PCA](https://github.com/Randalburks/Skin-Tone-Detection-Using-Image-Segmentation-and-PCA)
- Implemented image preprocessing and segmentation techniques to isolate skin regions from images.  
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and clustering of skin tone ranges.  
- Demonstrated how computer vision and statistical modeling can be combined to explore bias and diversity considerations in image data.  

### [Image Classification Using Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Randalburks/Image-Classification-Using-Naive-Bayes)
- Built a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish between real animal images and animated character images.  
- Engineered features such as color profiles, presence/absence of specific attributes, and positioning for classification.  
- Showcased the application of probabilistic modeling and feature independence assumptions in image recognition tasks.  

### [Customer Sentiment Analysis of E-Commerce Reviews](https://github.com/Randalburks/Customer-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Women-s-Clothing-E-Commerce-Review-)
- Conducted natural language processing (NLP) on 20,000+ customer reviews from a women’s clothing e-commerce dataset.  
- Performed sentiment classification, topic modeling, and clustering to extract key themes and consumer insights.  
- Compared text-based sentiment with star ratings to evaluate alignment between written feedback and quantitative scoring.  
- Produced visualizations to communicate customer pain points and opportunities for product improvement.  

### [NFL Clutch Performance Analytics (CSE 482 Final Project)](https://github.com/Randalburks/CSE_482_Final_Project.git)
- Designed an end-to-end analytics pipeline transforming 190,000+ NFL play-by-play records into structured datasets focused on high-leverage clutch scenarios.
- Engineered performance features to evaluate late-game decision-making and quantify factors influencing win probability under pressure.
- Applied regression-based modeling and performance evaluation techniques to identify key drivers of clutch efficiency across teams and seasons.
- Demonstrated how large-scale sports data can be cleaned, modeled, and summarized to support outcome analysis and strategic insights.

### [Walmart Intelligence Dashboard – Sales Forecasting & Pricing Analytics](https://github.com/Randalburks/Final-Walmart-Intelligence-Dashboard.git)￼
- Built an interactive analytics dashboard integrating multiple structured datasets to analyze sales performance across 3,049 products and 10 stores.
- Engineered time-series and pricing-related features including rolling averages, lagged sales, and calendar effects to support forecasting and trend analysis.
- Developed and evaluated multiple forecasting models to compare predictive performance and identify key drivers of demand variability.
- Created executive-ready visualizations with KPIs and scenario controls to communicate insights for pricing, inventory, and business decision-making.
