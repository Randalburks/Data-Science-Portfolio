# Data Science Portfolio – Randal Burks

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository highlights selected projects that demonstrate my skills in machine learning, data visualization, and statistical modeling.  

## Projects

### [Skin Tone Detection Using Image Segmentation and PCA](https://github.com/Randalburks/Skin-Tone-Detection-Using-Image-Segmentation-and-PCA)
- Implemented image preprocessing and segmentation techniques to isolate skin regions from images.  
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and clustering of skin tone ranges.  
- Demonstrated how computer vision and statistical modeling can be combined to explore bias and diversity considerations in image data.  

### [Image Classification Using Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Randalburks/Image-Classification-Using-Naive-Bayes)
- Built a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish between real animal images and animated character images.  
- Engineered features such as color profiles, presence/absence of specific attributes, and positioning for classification.  
- Showcased the application of probabilistic modeling and feature independence assumptions in image recognition tasks.  

### [Customer Sentiment Analysis of E-Commerce Reviews](https://github.com/Randalburks/Customer-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Women-s-Clothing-E-Commerce-Review-)
- Conducted natural language processing (NLP) on 20,000+ customer reviews from a women’s clothing e-commerce dataset.  
- Performed sentiment classification, topic modeling, and clustering to extract key themes and consumer insights.  
- Compared text-based sentiment with star ratings to evaluate alignment between written feedback and quantitative scoring.  
- Produced visualizations to communicate customer pain points and opportunities for product improvement.
