# Data Science Portfolio – Randal Burks

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This repository highlights selected projects that demonstrate my skills in machine learning, data visualization, and statistical modeling.  

## Projects

### [Skin Tone Detection Using Image Segmentation and PCA](https://github.com/Randalburks/Skin-Tone-Detection-Using-Image-Segmentation-and-PCA)
- Applied image segmentation and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to detect and cluster skin tone ranges.
- Demonstrated preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and computer vision techniques.

### [Image Classification Using Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Randalburks/Image-Classification-Using-Naive-Bayes)
- Built a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish between real platypus images and animated character images.
- Implemented feature extraction and probabilistic modeling.

### [Customer Sentiment Analysis of E-Commerce Reviews](https://github.com/Randalburks/Customer-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Women-s-Clothing-E-Commerce-Review-)
- Performed text sentiment analysis on women’s clothing reviews.
- Applied natural language processing (NLP), topic modeling, and clustering to reveal insights.

### [Population Growth Modeling](https://github.com/Randalburks/PopulatonGrowth-GroupMRH)
